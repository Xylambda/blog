I'm Alejandro, a Junior Data Scienctist.

I am currently working as quantitative researcher, developing mathematical models to understand
the FX market.

My academic background includes a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Big Data minor. 
The latter as a result of my stay abroad in Netherlands.

Regarding my personal interests, I like films and music. I play piano and guitar in my
free time and I also like to read fantasy books. I'm also interested in politics and science
in general.

Hope you found what you were looking for and do not hesitate to leave a messege with any question
you may have.
