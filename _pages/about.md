### Who are you?
Hi! I'm Alejandro, a Data Scientist. I am currently working as quantitative 
researcher, developing mathematical models to understand the FX market.

### What did you study?
My academic background includes a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a 
Big Data minor. The latter as a result of my stay abroad in Netherlands.

### I want to know you
I like films and music. I mean, I REALLY like films and music. I play piano 
and guitar in my free time and I recorded some homemade films (that will never 
see the light) with my friends. 

I also like to read fantasy books and travelling. I'm also interested in 
politics and science in general.

### I want to contact you
You can contact me using the email I have on my GitHub web profile.

### How did you make this site?
